/*Created a new form named animals. 
Created an array named myAnimals with these animals in it:
   dog, cat, horse, meerkat
Got the name of an animal from the user and adds it to the end of the array using an array method. 
Included code so the user can use any mix of case to enter the animal name.
Output the last animal in the array to an alert using a template literal to the console with the format below. Used the myAnimals array in the template literal to show the last animal added:*/
/*
let animals= ["dog", "cat", "horse", "mouse", "pig", "cow", "ferret","lizard","frog"]

let addAnimal= prompt("Enter a new animal to add to the array")
let newAnimal= addAnimal.toLowerCase()

animals.push(newAnimal)
alert(`The last animal is ${animals[animals.length - 1]}`)
